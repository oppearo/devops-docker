## 2.5:

```
PS ...\devopswithdocker\part2\2.5> docker-compose up -d --scale compute=5
Docker Compose is now in the Docker CLI, try `docker compose up`
Creating network "25_default" with the default driver
Creating 25_compute_1  ... done
Creating 25_compute_2  ... done
Creating 25_compute_3  ... done
Creating 25_compute_4  ... done
Creating 25_compute_5  ... done
Creating load-balancer ... done
Creating calculator    ... done
```

As long as the number of instances of `compute` is 2 or more, it will pass the tester.
